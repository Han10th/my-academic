abstract: We build a deep neural network based on quasi-conformal theories,
  called QC-net, to obtain diffeomorphic registration maps between corresponding
  data. QC-net take the landmarks in the to-be-registered images as input and
  output the registration mapping between them. The loss function of the QC-Net
  is carefully designed using the Beltrami coefficient to guarantee a
  homeomorphic registration map. This is the first network to build a neural
  network with homeomorphic output. Once the network has been trained, the
  registration map can be obtained efficiently in real-time. Extensive numerical
  experiments have been carried out, which demonstrate its effectiveness to
  compute bijective landmark-matching registration with high accuracy. Our
  proposed QC-net has also been successfully applied to various real
  applications, such as medical image registration and shape remeshing.
