abstract: We build a deep neural network based on quasi-conformal theories,
  called QC-net, to obtain diffeomorphic registration maps between corresponding
  data. QC-Net incorporates data information from training data. As such, QC-net
  can output a meaningful registration map based on the known data structure
  learn from the network. The loss function of the QC-Net is carefully designed
  using the Beltrami coefficient, so that a quasi-conformal and hence
  homeomorphic registration map. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
  network to build a neural network with homeomorphic output. Once the network
  has been trained, the registration map can be obtained efficiently in
  real-time. Extensive numerical experiments have been carried out, which
  demonstrate its effectiveness to compute bijective landmark-matching
  registration with high accuracy. Our proposed QC-Net has also been
  successfully applied to various real applications, such as medical image
  registration and human face matching.
