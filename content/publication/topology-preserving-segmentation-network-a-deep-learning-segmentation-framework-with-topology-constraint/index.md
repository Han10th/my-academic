abstract: In this work, we propose a new framework that enable prior knowleadge
  usage for deep learning model. Through such prior knowleadge, there will be no
  outliers in the predicted output. Besides, we can also combining standard
  U-Net with topology-preserving network to remove the outliers and noise in the
  predicted masks of U-Net.
