abstract: Information is not generally distributed uniformly in an image domain.
  Thus, to make the convolutional neural network focus more on those important,
  some deformation on convolution windows or feature maps should be applied.
  Besides, the topology of an image should be preserved from the ideas for
  defining the convolution operation.
