abstract: Information is not generally distributed uniformly in an image domain.
  Thus, to make the convolutional neural network focus more on those important,
  some deformation on convolution windows or feature maps should be applied.
  Besides, the topology of an image should be preserved from the ideas for
  defining the convolution operation. However, controlling topology is hard and
  not convenient for existing methods since they all use vector representation
  for displacements. In this paper, we proposed Quasi-Conformal Transformer
  Network using Beltrami representation, which is a strong representation to
  control the bijectivity and the degree of geometric deformations. Together
  with our Beltrami Solver Net(BSN), we proposed an end-to-end learnable
  network, which advantages other works on its power to control the geometric
  deformation of the feature maps.
