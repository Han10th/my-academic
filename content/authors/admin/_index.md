I graduated M.Phil. from the Division of Mathematics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Lok Ming (Ronald) Lui](http://www.lokminglui.com/). I got my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematics at Sun Yat-Sen University under the supervision of Prof. Ying Jiang. I also have a precious experience at Shenzhen University with [Prof.Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). My research interests include Medical Imaging and Computational Geometry.
